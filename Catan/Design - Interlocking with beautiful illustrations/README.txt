# Summary

The center tiles have straight edge or jigsaw options (straight is recommended) and measure 3 3/4" x 4" each. This digital file includes:

-6 grain tiles (wheat). 
-6 lumber tiles (tree). 
-6 wool tiles (sheep)
-5 ore tiles (stone)
-5 brick tiles
-2 desert tiles
-Center pips
-30 Felt cutouts for center tiles and pips

These tiles interlock with the waves I made and are enough for the base 2-4 player game + 4-6 player expansion. https://www.etsy.com/listing/540076560/catan-wave-borders?ref=listing-shop-header-0

---------------

Catan set made by Glowforge and is filed under the Creative Commons Attribution. It cannot replace the official Catan game produced by Mayfair, and a copy of said game will need to be purchased in order to have all pieces required for gameplay.

Original Glowforge files: https://glowforge.com/laser-cut-catan-board
Official Mayfair Catan board game: http://www.catan.com/

This version you are downloading here was compiled by Carlotta4th and has minor changes from the Glowforge files, as follows:

-Pieces added to expand the set from 2-4 players to 4-6 players
-Center circles given a larger lip
-Sheep tile inverted so outside etch is lighter
-Various cleanup, some lines thickened others reduced, etc.
-Tile sizes scaled down slightly
-Cut lines recreated and are now .001 thickness
